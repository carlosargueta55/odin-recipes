    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a colorful and very tasty mix of chicken, mangos, and avocados in a spicy lime dressing.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chili garlic sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded, cooked chicken</li>
        <li>2 medium mangos - peeled, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>2 avocados - peeled, pitted and diced</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package spring lettuce mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato sauce, water, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, crushed garlic, bouillon cube, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes. Let salsa roja cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a blender halfway with the salsa roja. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with remaining salsa roja. Return to saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes more stirring occasionally. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour, and refrigerate. </li>
        <li>Place cabbage and carrots in a large bowl. Add 4 cups boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well. Mix in vinegar, scallions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Chill curtido until serving.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost fully cooked and not yet crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon and grease (if desired) to a food processor. Add tomatoes, quartered green bell pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season the chicharron with salt. </li>
        <li>Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel. </li>
        <li> Heat 1/2 cup oil a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb; put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining dough and chicharron.</li>
        <li>Serve each pupusa topped with 2 tablespoons of curtido and 1 tablespoon of salsa roja.</li>
    </ol>
